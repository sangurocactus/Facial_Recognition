# Facial Keypoint Recognition
Abstract
This report summarizes our approach towards predicting facial keypoints from a given set of images in the Kaggle facial keypoint detection challange. We first approached the problem with a baseline model which is a regression model, and enhanced our model performance by introducing convolutional neutral networks (CNN) as well as increasing variance e.g. by adding dropouts. We were able to improve the model performance by changing the model infrastructure (64% improvement from baseline). In an attempt to further increase the performance, we tried using image data enhancement methods, like stretching, flipping, rotating etc, in order to generate more training data for our models. A challange here was to retrieve the stretched, flipped, rotated coordinate points. For a range of operations, besides horizontal flipping, we were able to retrieve the points and hence increase our training set. It indeed gave us the best performance on the Kaggle test set and the best place on the leaderboard (public leaderboard: 69th/ private leaderboard: 79th). We then trained the enhanced CNN model on this set. Finally, we created an ensemble model to expand on the Kaggle challange: In reality it is not known which keypoints are present. The ensemble model should classify the presence of keypoints and then predict their location.
